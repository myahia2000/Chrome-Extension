# Privacy Policy for Quran Kareem Radio

**Last Updated: February 22, 2026**

This Privacy Policy describes how the **Quran Kareem Radio** Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user information.

## 1. Data Collection
We believe in absolute privacy.
- **No Personal Information**: The Extension does NOT collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) such as names, email addresses, or location data.
- **No Web History**: The Extension does NOT track your browsing history or monitor the websites you visit.
- **Local Storage ONLY**: The Extension uses the `chrome.storage` API solely to save your local preferences, specifically your **volume level** and **playback state**. This data stays on your machine and is never sent to our servers.

## 2. Audio Streaming
The Extension provides a stream from an external audio source (`radiojar.com`). When you play the radio, your browser connects directly to the stream provider. Please refer to their respective privacy policies regarding data handled during streaming (such as your IP address, which is standard for HTTP requests).

## 3. Data Sharing
Since we do not collect any user data, we do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer any information to third parties.

## 4. Permissions Justification
- **`offscreen`**: Used only to host the audio player so it can play in the background.
- **`storage`**: Used only to remember your volume settings.

## 5. Changes to This Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## 6. Contact
If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer through the Chrome Web Store support link.
